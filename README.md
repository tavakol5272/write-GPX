# Write GPX
MoveApps

Github repository: *github.com/movestore/write-GPX*

## Description
This App takes movement data and exports all locations as a standard downloadble `.gpx` file using `sf::st_write()` with the GDAL GPX driver.

## Documentation
GPX (the GPS Exchange Format) is a light-weight XML data format for the interchange of GPS data (waypoints, routes, and tracks) between applications and Web services on the Internet.
GPX is being used by hundreds of software programs and Web services for GPS data exchange, mapping, and geocaching.(more information: http://www.topografix.com )

This App exports move2 object as GPX waypoints (contains, for each point, the coordinates, timestamp, individual ID,
and all additional attributes supported via GPX extensions if they are listed in the default XML name schema under http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/  ),
and can be viewed and used in common GIS and GPS tools like QGIS, GPX viewers, navigation devices Garmin, Strava, and mapping services.
